```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this project, we will compare the sentiment of twitter messages from Trump and Obama. First we will read in the required libraries.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(caret)

houses = read_csv("http://tiny.cc/mosaic/SaratogaHouses.csv")
houses %>% head() %>% kable() 

```



```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

houses <- houses %>% mutate(Fireplace = ifelse(Fireplace == "N",0,1))

```
