<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Trump vs Obama in Twitter Word Frequencies</h1>
<h4 class="author"><em>Oliver Thistlethwaite</em></h4>

</div>


<p>In this project, we will compare the word frequencies in twitter messages from Trump and Obama. First we will read in the required libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(purrr)
library(twitteR)
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)
library(wordcloud2)</code></pre>
<p>To set up <em>TwitteR</em>, please see <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/setting-up-the-twitter-r-package-for-text-analytics/">R Bloggers</a>.</p>
<p>Now we’ll load the last 3200 tweets from each of Trump and Obama. Note the number of tweets will be less since we are excluding retweets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trump_tweets &lt;- userTimeline(&quot;realDonaldTrump&quot;, n=3200)
trump_tweets_df &lt;- tbl_df(map_df(trump_tweets, as.data.frame))

obama_tweets &lt;- userTimeline(&quot;BarackObama&quot;, n=3200)
obama_tweets_df &lt;- tbl_df(map_df(obama_tweets, as.data.frame))</code></pre>
<p>Now we’ll count word frequencies for both of them and create word clouds.</p>
<div id="for-trump" class="section level2">
<h2>For Trump</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>tweets &lt;- trump_tweets_df
