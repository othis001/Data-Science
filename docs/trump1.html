<p>In this project, we will compare bigrams and word frequencies in twitter messages from Trump and Obama. First we will read in the required libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(purrr)
library(twitteR)
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)
library(wordcloud2)

library(igraph)
library(ggraph)</code></pre>
<p>To set up <em>TwitteR</em>, please see <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/setting-up-the-twitter-r-package-for-text-analytics/">R Bloggers</a>.</p>
<p>Now we’ll load the last 3200 tweets from each of Trump and Obama. Note the number of tweets will be less since we are excluding retweets.</p>
