```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this project, we will analyze house prices from Saratoga, CA.

First we will read in the required libraries and a database of house prices.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(caret)

houses = read_csv("http://tiny.cc/mosaic/SaratogaHouses.csv")
houses %>% head() %>% kable() 

```

From examining the head of the file, we see what information the database provides us.

Next we will convert all the columns into numeric data.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

houses <- houses %>% mutate(Fireplace = ifelse(Fireplace == "N",0,1))

```

Next we will create a training set and testing set to test some machine learning algorithms. We'll use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(3)

index <- 1:nrow(houses)
testindex <- sample(index, trunc(length(index)/5))

train <- na.omit(houses[-testindex,]) 

test <- na.omit(houses[testindex,])
testsize <- nrow(test)

```

We'll compare the different models by mean squared error. First we'll try the NULL Model (The model whose output is always the mean of the output variable).

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

mod <- lm(Price ~ 1, data = train)

pred <- predict(mod, test)

mse <- sum( ( pred - test$Price )^2 ) / testsize

mse^(1/2)

```

So on average our error is about $100,000 which is unacceptable.

Next we'll try a linear model.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

mod <- lm(Price ~ ., data = train)

pred <- predict(mod, test)

mse <- sum( ( pred - test$Price )^2 ) / testsize

mse^(1/2)

```

This is significantly better.

Now we'll try a Conditional Inference Tree.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

mod <- train(Price ~ ., data = train, method = "ctree")

pred <- predict(mod, test)

mse <- sum( ( pred - test$Price )^2 ) / testsize

mse^(1/2)

```

More or less the same as the linear model. Finally we will plot the resulting model.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=18, fig.height=12}

plot(mod$finalModel)

```


##Principal Component Analysis

Finally we'll try to apply PCA (principal component analysis) and see if that improved our results. First we will create the principal components using the feature columns.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

prin_comp <- prcomp(train %>% select(-Price), scale. = T)

std_dev <- prin_comp$sdev
pr_var <- std_dev^2
prop_varex <- pr_var/sum(pr_var)

```

Next we will examine the cumulative proportion of variance explained for the principal components.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

plot(cumsum(prop_varex), xlab = "Principal Component",
              ylab = "Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained",
              type = "b")

```

Most of the variance is explained by the first two components. Next we will plot the resultant first two principal components.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=12}

biplot(prin_comp, scale = 0)

```

Now to apply some machine learning algorithms, we creat PCA training and testing sets.

```{r}

train.pca <- data.frame(Price = train$Price, prin_comp$x) 

test.pca <- as.data.frame( predict(prin_comp, newdata = test %>% select(-Price)) )
test.pca$Price <- test$Price

```

Applying a linear model to just the first principal component produces the best mean squared error.

```{r, warning = FALSE}

mod <- lm(Price ~ PC1, data = train.pca)

pred <- predict(mod, test.pca)

mse <- sum( ( pred - test.pca$Price )^2 ) / testsize

mse^(1/2)

```

Observe even though we failed to improve the mean squared error, we did manage to reduce the problem from 6 dimensions to 1 dimension and obtain a similar mean squared error.
